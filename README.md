## What it is

* A simple builder of RewriteCond / RewriteRule's handling GET strings in any order.
* Free and open source

## What it is not

* Perfect

## Todo:

* [ ] Nginx Option
	* This is proving to be more difficult than initially anticipated. Handling the GET parameters in **any order** may require the use of
	if statements which is frowned upon in the Nginx community and has performance overheads.
